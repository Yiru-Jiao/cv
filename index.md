Being part of [<u>Delft AI Labs Programme</u>](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/tu-delft-ai-labs), Yiru Jiao joined [<u>CityAI lab</u>](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ai/cityai-lab) and [<u>DiTT lab</u>](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/transport-planning/research/labs/data-analytics-and-traffic-simulation-lab/dittlab-tu-delft/) as a PhD student from 15 Jan. 2021. She is under the supervision of [<u>Dr.ir. Simeon C. Calvert</u>](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=pwVbHHEAAAAJ&hl=nl), [<u>Dr.ir. Sander van Cranenburgh</u>](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=-FNYwWYAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=6173373803492361994&oi=ao), and [<u>Prof.dr.ir. Hans van Lint</u>](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=Q95PbrMAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=6173373803492361994&oi=sra). 

I'm a passionate researcher working in autonomous road safety, methodologically in a geospatial time series data-driven way. My research aims at safer traffic for all modes of road users by automated technologies, including but not limited to automated vehicles, data-empowered traffic monitoring, and data-driven infrastructure&policy improvement.

- My PhD research is about:
  - vehicle interactions (safe and unsafe) among human drivers as well as between human drivers and automated vehicles,
  - enhance road safety, promote autonomous driving, and gain more understanding of interactive human behaviour. 
- <b>Read more</b> about my studies at CityAI lab's [<u>project site.</u>](https://www.cityai-lab.nl/vehicle-coordination/)

This digital CV is very bibliometrically formed for HR's or quantitative eyes. You are invited to visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Yiru-Jiao) and use a qualitative view to look at me and my research. I believe all researchers in academia would ask the same. We work for a better world, not for producing publications.
