My research interests are in collective patterns emerged from individual interactions. 
- My PhD research is about:
  - vehicle interaction (safe and unsafe) among human drivers and between human drivers and automated vehicles,
  - enhance traffic safety, promote autonomous driving, and gain more understanding of human driving behaviour. 
- <b>Read more</b> about my studies at CityAI lab's [<u>project site.</u>](https://www.cityai-lab.nl/vehicle-coordination/)
