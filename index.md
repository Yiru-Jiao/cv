During Jan. 15th 2021 and Jan. 20th 2026, Yiru Jiao pursued her PhD degree in Delft University of Technology, supported by [<u>Delft AI Labs & Talent Programme</u>](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/tu-delft-ai-labs) and under the supervision of [<u>Dr.ir. Simeon C. Calvert</u>](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=pwVbHHEAAAAJ&hl=nl), [<u>Dr.ir. Sander van Cranenburgh</u>](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=-FNYwWYAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=6173373803492361994&oi=ao), and [<u>Prof.dr.ir. Hans van Lint</u>](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=Q95PbrMAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=6173373803492361994&oi=sra). Her research aims at autonomous road safety to enable safer traffic for all modes of road users by automated technologies, including but not limited to automated vehicles (AVs), data-empowered traffic safety monitoring, and data-driven policy improvement. Most papers published during her PhD are openly accessible thanks to TU Delft Library. For every paper, experiment code and instructions are open-sourced at GitHub. To know a bit more about my PhD research, you are welcome to visit [<u>CityAI lab project site</u>](https://www.cityai-lab.nl/vehicle-coordination/).

This digital CV is very bibliometrically formed for HR's or quantitative eyes. You are invited to visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Yiru-Jiao) and use a qualitative view to look at me and my research. I believe all researchers in academia would ask the same. We work for a better world, not for producing publications.
