My research interests are generally in collective patterns emerged in individual interactions. 
- My PhD research is about:
  - vehicle interactions (safe and unsafe) among human drivers as well as between human drivers and automated vehicles,
  - enhance road safety, promote autonomous driving, and gain more understanding of interactive human behaviour. 
- <b>Read more</b> about my studies at CityAI lab's [<u>project site.</u>](https://www.cityai-lab.nl/vehicle-coordination/)

This digital CV is very bibliometrically formed for HR's or quantitative eyes. But please, if in any way possible, visit my GitHub page and use a qualitative view to look at me and my research. I believe all researchers in academia would ask the same. We work for a better world, not for producing publications.
