Efficient and safe use of road space in cities is crucial for reducing congestion and improving mobility. However, vehicle movement in urban areas involves intricate two-dimensional interaction, which are not sufficiently accounted for in current traffic models yet. As such, my PhD research is investigating how humans communicate with and react to each other while driving in cities, and furthering our understanding of human perception and use of road space. Ultimately, the aim of my research is to answer how we can improve the coordination of vehicles in urban traffic to achieve more efficient and safe use of the shared road space. This will help enhance traffic safety, promote efficiency, and gain more understanding of human driving behaviour.
